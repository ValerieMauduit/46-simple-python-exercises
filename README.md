Torbjoern Lager's 46 Simple Python Exercises

>This is version 0.45 of a collection of simple Python exercises constructed (but in many cases only found and collected) by Torbjörn Lager (torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se). Most of them involve characters, words and phrases, rather than numbers, and are therefore suitable for students interested in language rather than math.

Description found [here](http://easyprog99.blogspot.com/2017/02/46-simple-python-exercises.html).

The original collection was created by [Torbjörn Lager](https://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/staff/?languageId=100001&userId=xlagto).
