# 46-simple-python-exercises

Torbjörn Lager's 46 Simple Python Exercises

>This is version 0.45 of a collection of simple Python exercises constructed (but in many cases only found and collected) by Torbjörn Lager (torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se). Most of them involve characters, words and phrases, rather than numbers, and are therefore suitable for students interested in language rather than math.

Description found [here](http://easyprog99.blogspot.com/2017/02/46-simple-python-exercises.html).

## Motivation

Goal is to complete at least 4 exercises a week in order to continue practicing Python programming and to continue improving.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7)

### Installing


1. In the terminal go to an appropriate folder where you want to clone this repo and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/rrsw/46-simple-python-exercises/
```

2. Then move to the newly created directory:
```
cd 46-simple-python-exercises/
```

I also test my code in [IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html) during writing process.

## Test

I wrote some automated tests for each exercise. My tests are quite simple for the moments. Don't hesitate to use them

- [] Fix some errors
- [] Add test12 and test19

## Acknowledgements

The original collection was constructed, but also found and collected by [Torbjörn Lager](https://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/staff/?languageId=100001&userId=xlagto).
